          My first stint with programming came in the form of a introductory high school class.
          I enjoyed the satisfaction of seeing the final result of something I created and continued on from there.
          I'm currently seeking an 8-12 month internship starting from May 2025. 
          Aside from coding, I enjoy the gym, basketball, music, gaming and tinkering with electronics.
